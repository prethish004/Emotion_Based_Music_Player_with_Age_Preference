## Project Structure
```
emotion-based-music-recommendation/
├── app.py      # Handles user input for emotion, age, and languages
├── hello.py        # Fetches songs based on the input and YouTube API
├── README.md             # Project documentation
├── requirements.txt      # Required Python libraries
└── example_output/       # Example outputs (optional)
```

## Usage
1. Run the `app.py` script to input your details:
   ```
    python -m streamlit run app.py

    ```
3. The script will call `fetch_songs.py` to recommend songs based on your input.
4. Results will include up to **6 top songs**, with at least one being an animated movie song.

## Example

### Output:
1. Song Title: *Let It Go* - Animated Movie Song
2. Song Title: *Uptown Funk* - Trending in English

## Troubleshooting
### Common Errors
- **IndexError: pop from empty list**  
  Ensure the `fallback_songs` list contains at least one item before accessing it. This is already handled in the latest version.

- **YouTube Data API Quota Exceeded**  
  Reduce the number of API requests or use a different API key with a higher quota.

- **Model Compilation Warning**  
  Ensure the model is compiled after loading:
  ```python
  model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
  ```
